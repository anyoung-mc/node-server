# Simple Static Server

## Installation

Clone Repository

```sh
cd <PATH_TO_REPO>
npm i
```

## Running the server

```sh
npm start
```

## Hosting files

This is a static file server so no extra execution is performed, files in the `public` directory are hosted at `localhost:3333`.

for example a file located in `<PATH_TO_REPO>/public/path/to/file.exe` is hosted at `localhost:3333/path/to/file.ext`
